Python Reproduction of the Empirical Bayes Book 

## Movitation

This book aims to reproduce the code in David Robinson's [Introduction to Empirical Bayes](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical-bayes-book/) in Python. I think reproducing the code in another language is a great way to help me learn and keep being familiar in both language. It will be great if some of the content here also helps you.
